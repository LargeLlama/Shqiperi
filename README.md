## APCS2 Final Project -- Maze Runner

### Proposal
**Click [_HERE_](./docs/proposal.pdf) our proposal**

### Description
A maze is randomly generated using the algorithm provided below. An Albanian warrior by the name of Dubim must face monsters, traps, and pick up items along the way to survive and escape the maze! ⚔️⚔️⚔️

To control Dubim use the keyboard's 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' characters. Follow a path until Dubim reaches the door! 🏆🏆🏆

### How To Launch
1. From the root of the repo cd into the maze directory
2. In the maze directory run maze.pde and click play.

### How to Play


### How it Works (The Algo)
1. Pick a random cell C to start off with, and set it's visited value to true
2. Move to any one of its unvisited neighbors, removing the walls between the cells
3. If no neighbors are available, backtrack until a neighbor is found
4. Repeat until you backtrack back to the original cell
