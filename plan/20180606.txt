	========================={ Crucial Jobs }=========================

	- [COMPLETED] Generating Maze (prerequisite for placing sprite)
	
	 * collaborative
	 * Done using the growing tree algo, using the recursive backtracking style
	 * Algorithm (also found in README) 
	    + Pick a random cell C to start off with, and set it's visited value to true
	    + Move to any one of its unvisited neighbors, removing the walls between the cells
	    + If no neighbors are available, backtrack until a neighbor is found
	    + repeat until you backtrack back to the original cell

	 * this creates a randomly generated maze with exactly one solution everytime!

	- [COMPLETED] Creating starting and ending markers for the maze

	- [COMPLETED] Placing sprite in Maze (prerequisite for sprite movement)

	- [COMPLETED] Moving sprite through maze

	- [COMPLETED] Creating classes for Monsters, Hero and Items
	

	**********************************************************************
	
	- [WORK IN PROGRESS] Generating items for the player to pick up and use
	   * will make use of the item classes that have been made
	       + already tested that they work on the java end, need to import into processing
	
	- [WORK IN PROGRESS] Making an exit for the maze
	   * currently does not lead to another maze
	   * Each exit should lead to another maze, but if not that we can just make a new one for each thing.
	   * Allow user to start a new level with the same items from the previous level.
	
	- [COMPLETED] Not allowing Hero to cross wall
	
	- [UNSTARTED] Fighting display between monster and hero
	        * Possibly some type of animation for picking up items and walking over traps as well.
	
	========================={ Non-Essential }=========================

	- Sprite movement animation
	 * collaborative

	- Including traps
