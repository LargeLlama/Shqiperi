Crucial Jobs

- [COMPLETED] Generating Maze (prerequisite for placing sprite)
  * collaborative
  * Done using the growing tree algo, using the recursive backtracking style
  * Algorithm -
     + Pick a random cell C to start off with, and set it's visited value to true
     + Move to any one of its unvisited neighbors, removing the walls between the cells
     + If no neighbors are available, backtrack until a neighbor is found
     + repeat until you backtrack back to the original cell
  * this creates a randomly generated maze with exactly one solution everytime!
- Importing the relevant java packages we made (entities and items) into Processing so we can actually use them in the context of the maze
- Creating starting and ending markers for the maze
- Placing sprite in Maze (prerequisite for sprite movement)
- Moving sprite through maze
- Generating items for the player to pick up and use
    * will make use of the item classes that have been made
        + already tested that they work on the java end, need to import into processing
- Making an exit for the maze
    * Each exit should lead to another maze, but if not that we can just make a new one for each thing.

Non-essential:

- Sprite movement animation
  * collaborative
- Including traps
